# Parsing XML using Python ElementTree

## What is XML?
- XML documents have sections, called elements, defined by a beginning and an ending tag. 
  - A `tag` is a markup construct that begins with < and ends with >. 
  - The characters between the start-tag and end-tag, if there are any, are the element's content. 
  - Elements can contain markup, including other elements, which are called "child elements".
- The largest, top-level element is called the `root`, which contains all other elements.
- `Attributes` are nameâ€“value pair that exist within a start-tag or empty-element tag. 
  - An XML attribute can only have a single value.
  - Each attribute can appear at most once on each element.

## ElementTree
- Python's built in library, `ElementTree`, has functions to read and manipulate XMLs.
