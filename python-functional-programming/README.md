# Python Functional Programming

Functions are first-class citizens in Python.

## What's a First-Class Object?
- can be passed to a function as an argument
- can be returned from a function
- can be assigned to a variable
- can be stored in a data structure

## Higher-order functions
Higher-order functions are functions that take a function as an `argument` and/or `return` a function.

## Lambda expressions
- Limitations:
  - The "body" of a lambda is limited to a single expression.
  - no assignments
  - no annotations
  - single logical line of code
